# Containers

The shipped Docker image, compose recipe, volume layout, security model,
and resource tuning. For Kubernetes / OpenShift, see
[`kubernetes/DEPLOY.md`](../kubernetes/DEPLOY.md). For non-container
reverse-proxy + TLS recipes, see [`deployment.md`](./deployment.md).

## Why containers

Pi-forge is single-tenant. The agent's `bash` tool is a real shell;
`write` / `edit` touch the workspace; the integrated terminal spawns a
PTY with the server's permissions. The container bounds the blast
radius (workspace bind mount + ephemeral container fs), pins the
runtime (Node + native bindings), and makes deploys reproducible.

## Image overview

`docker/Dockerfile` is multi-stage:

| Stage | Base | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `python-base` | `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` | Source for the Python 3.12 + pip runtime copied into the shared Node base |
| `node-python-base` | `node:22-bookworm-slim` | Shared Debian slim base with Node.js 22 plus Python 3.12 + pip |
| `builder` | `node-python-base` | Installs all deps including devDeps, compiles native bindings (`node-pty`), runs `npm run build` for both packages |
| `runtime` | `node-python-base` | Production deps + built artifacts only. Adds `git`, `gh`, `tea`, `ripgrep`, `bash`, `curl`, `less`, `procps`, `vim`, `gosu`, and the C++ toolchain needed for native-module rebuilds during in-container development. Default mode drops the server to `pi`; sandbox mode keeps the server as root so it can drop model/user tool processes to `pi-tools`; `SHELL=/bin/bash` so xterm sessions land in bash, not dash |

Final image size varies by architecture and cache state. Debian-based
(not Alpine) because the Node native-module ecosystem ships glibc
prebuilds; on musl, those packages fall back to source builds.

Installed at runtime:

- **Node.js 22**
- **Python 3.12 + pip** — callable as `python3`, `python`, or `py`
- **`tini`** — init for signal forwarding + zombie reaping
- **`git`** — required by the agent's `bash` tool and the GitPanel routes
- **`gh`** — GitHub CLI for working with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise
- **`tea`** — Gitea/Forgejo CLI, pinned from the upstream Gitea release
- **`ripgrep`** — pi's `grep` tool delegates to `rg` when present;
  silently degrades to a Node walker without it
- **`vim`** — familiar in-terminal editor for the integrated terminal
- **`make`, `g++`** — keeps `npm install` / `npm rebuild` working
  inside the running container when native modules such as `node-pty`
  need to compile against the container's Node ABI

### User and permissions

The image creates two users:

- `pi` (`PUID` / `PGID`, default `1000:1000`) owns the home layout and
  preserves legacy path/env expectations.
- `pi-tools` (`AGENT_TOOL_UID` / `AGENT_TOOL_GID` in compose, default
  `1001:1001`) is the restricted identity used when
  `AGENT_TOOL_SANDBOX_ENABLED=true`. It has its own writable home at
  `/home/pi-tools`, exposed to sandboxed shells as `AGENT_TOOL_HOME`.

By default (`AGENT_TOOL_SANDBOX_ENABLED=false`), compose starts the
server as the legacy `pi` user directly and drops all Linux
capabilities. The entrypoint only falls back to `gosu pi` for ad-hoc
`docker run` invocations that still start as root. In sandbox mode,
the server remains root. This is deliberate: the identity sandbox needs
the server to call `setuid` / `setgid` for child tools while keeping
server-owned config, forge data, and mounted secrets unreadable by
`pi-tools`.

Sandbox mode has a stricter volume permission contract than the default
container. Read [`agent-tool-sandbox.md`](./agent-tool-sandbox.md)
before enabling it; the short version is:

- `/workspace` must be writable by `AGENT_TOOL_UID:GID`.
- `/home/pi/.pi` and `/home/pi/.pi/agent` must be traversable/readable
  by `AGENT_TOOL_UID:GID` for non-secret skills/resources.
- `/home/pi/.pi/agent/auth.json`, `models.json`, and `settings.json`
  must not be readable by `AGENT_TOOL_UID:GID`.
- `/home/pi/.pi-forge` and mounted secret dirs/files must not be
  readable by `AGENT_TOOL_UID:GID`.

On Docker Desktop / OrbStack / macOS, bind-mount ownership can be
virtualized; verify numeric ownership and mode bits inside the
container and from an app terminal. Use named volumes for sensitive
mounts if the host file-sharing layer makes ownership inconsistent.

## Volumes

Three bind-mounted volumes:

| Container path | Compose env var (default) | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `/workspace` | `WORKSPACE_HOST_PATH` (`~/.pi-forge-docker/workspace`) | User's project source. Projects are subfolders; kept outside the repository so checkout moves do not affect it |
| `/home/pi/.pi/agent` | `PI_CONFIG_HOST_PATH` (`~/.pi/agent`) | Pi SDK config — provider keys, models, settings. Shared with host pi CLI by default so secrets aren't copied into the image |
| `/home/pi/.pi-forge` | `FORGE_DATA_HOST_PATH` (`~/.pi-forge-docker`) | Forge state — `projects.json`, MCP / overrides / `jwt-secret` / `password-hash`. **Separate default** from the host path so the container has its own project list (host paths wouldn't resolve inside the container anyway) |

Session JSONLs default to `${WORKSPACE_PATH}/.pi/sessions/` so they
live on the workspace bind mount — backing up the workspace backs up
conversation history. Override with `SESSION_DIR` to relocate.

### Persistent Python packages outside this project

The image includes Python 3.12 and pip. Python is callable as `python3`,
`python`, or `py`. The shipped compose file does not persist Python
package installs by default. If you want package installs
to survive image rebuilds/container replacement without storing them in
the pi-forge checkout or workspace, mount an external host directory or
named volume at `/home/pi/.local` from your own Docker Compose override
or deployment wrapper:

```yaml
services:
  pi-forge:
    volumes:
      - ~/.pi-forge-python:/home/pi/.local
```

Then install with:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user <package>
```

The image sets `PYTHONUSERBASE=/home/pi/.local` and prepends
`/home/pi/.local/bin` to `PATH`, so console scripts installed by pip are
available automatically. On Linux, pre-create the host directory with the
same owner as `PUID` / `PGID` if Docker would otherwise create it as
root.

For per-project isolation, create virtual environments inside
`/workspace/<project>` instead; those persist because `/workspace` is a
bind mount.

## Environment variables

The full env-var reference lives in
[`configuration.md`](./configuration.md#environment-variables). The
container fixes the path-related vars; the shipped `docker/.env.example`
only includes the settings most Docker users edit on day one. Add
less-used server knobs (LDAP, CORS pinning, minimal UI, orchestration,
rate limits, terminal tuning, explicit JWT rotation, etc.) in your own
compose override (or by adding them to the compose `environment:` block)
when you need them.

| Variable | Container value |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3000` (map to host via `HOST_PORT`) |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` (forced — required for Docker port-forward to work) |
| `WORKSPACE_PATH` | `/workspace` |
| `PI_CONFIG_DIR` | `/home/pi/.pi/agent` |
| `FORGE_DATA_DIR` | `/home/pi/.pi-forge` |
| `PYTHONUSERBASE` | `/home/pi/.local` |
| `HOME` | `/home/pi`; writable by the `pi` user in regular/non-sandbox mode so CLIs such as `gh` can create `~/.config`, `~/.gitconfig`, and similar per-user files |
| `AGENT_TOOL_SANDBOX_ENABLED` | `false` by default; set `true` to run tool children as `pi-tools` |
| `AGENT_TOOL_UID` / `AGENT_TOOL_GID` | `1001` / `1001` in compose defaults |
| `AGENT_TOOL_HOME` | `/home/pi-tools`; writable home injected as `HOME` for sandboxed terminals/processes/model bash |
| `AGENT_TOOL_SANDBOX_CHOWN_PATHS` | unset by default; optional comma/whitespace list of existing non-secret paths that the root sandbox server recursively chowns to `AGENT_TOOL_UID:GID` on startup |

Set `UI_PASSWORD` and / or `API_KEY` in `.env` for any non-loopback
deploy — without them, auth is disabled. `JWT_SECRET` is intentionally
not in the sample `.env`; when auth is enabled, pi-forge auto-generates
and persists it under `${FORGE_DATA_DIR}/jwt-secret` unless you choose
to manage rotation yourself.

## Compose recipe

The shipped compose file (`docker/docker-compose.yml`) covers a typical
single-host deploy. Its `.env.example` is deliberately concise; advanced
server env vars remain supported but are documented instead of being
listed as runtime defaults. Quickstart:

```bash
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
# edit docker/.env — at minimum set HOST_PORT and (for any non-loopback
# deploy) UI_PASSWORD (JWT_SECRET auto-generates), or API_KEY
BUILD_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) docker compose up -d --build
```

`BUILD_COMMIT` embeds the checked-out short Git revision into the image and
shows it beside the package version in the Projects sidebar. Use the same
variable for every rebuild; without it, published or container-only builds
show `unknown` because the runtime image intentionally excludes `.git`.

### Rootless Podman on SELinux-enabled Linux

Keep SELinux enforcing. Use the Podman overlay to map the container's `pi`
user to the invoking host user and to give the three bind-mount sources
private SELinux labels:

```bash
cd docker
BUILD_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) PUID=$(id -u) PGID=$(id -g) \
  podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.podman.yml up -d --build
```

`userns_mode: keep-id` is Podman-specific, so it is intentionally kept out of
the Docker Compose base file. The overlay's `:Z` volume suffix relabels the
workspace, Pi agent config, and forge state directories for this one
container. Do not use the same host directories from another container unless
you deliberately manage compatible SELinux labels.

For Podman installations where `podman compose` delegates to a compose
provider, pass the same two `-f` files.

### Operations

```bash
# Logs (follow)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f

# Restart after editing .env
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml restart

# Rebuild on code change
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build

# Tear down (preserves volumes)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down

# Tear down + delete the named volumes (workspace stays — that's a bind mount)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

### Health check

The container has a baked-in health check that `fetch`s
`http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/health` every 30 s. After the start period,
three failures in a row mark it unhealthy. `docker compose ps` reports the
health state.

## Resource recommendations

Default `docker-compose.yml` doesn't pin CPU / memory limits — pi-forge
is lightweight at idle and the agent's resource use depends entirely on
what your prompts ask for. Reasonable starting points:

```yaml
services:
  pi-forge:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 2G    # base + room for buffered SSE / one PTY
        reservations:
          memory: 512M
```

Bump if you:

- **Run heavy build commands inside the integrated terminal** (npm builds,
  cargo, etc.) — terminal output is buffered in the agent's session
  history, which lives in memory until the SSE clients drain it
- **Open many terminals** — each PTY is a separate node-pty + child shell,
  ~5-15 MB per shell at rest, more if you `tail -f` something
- **Have very long running sessions** — pi accumulates message history in
  memory; compaction trims it but cycles in and out

CPU is rarely the bottleneck — most pi-forge CPU is forwarding bytes
between the LLM provider and the browser.

## Networking

The compose file binds host-side to `127.0.0.1:${HOST_PORT}:3000` by
default — only the host can reach the container. To expose to the LAN,
remove the `127.0.0.1:` prefix; for production, leave it loopback-only
and front with a reverse proxy on the same host.

Reverse-proxy + TLS recipes (nginx, Caddy, Traefik) including the
SSE-buffering and WebSocket-upgrade settings live in
[`deployment.md`](./deployment.md).

## Security inside the container

- **Root server, restricted tools (opt-in).** By default the server runs as `pi`.
  When `AGENT_TOOL_SANDBOX_ENABLED=true`, the server runs as root and model/user shell surfaces run
  as `pi-tools` and file tools / `@file` references are path-scoped.
  Keep secrets out of `/workspace`; workspace content is intentionally
  readable by the agent.
- **Minimal capabilities.** Regular compose starts as `pi`, drops all
  capabilities, and does not need `CHOWN`, `SETUID`, or `SETGID`. The optional
  `docker-compose.sandbox.yml` overlay starts as root and adds back
  only `CHOWN`, `SETUID`, and `SETGID`: `SETUID` / `SETGID` are required for
  the sandbox identity switch, and `CHOWN` is required so browser upload and
  new-file APIs can hand created workspace files/directories to `pi-tools`.
  `CHOWN` is also required when `AGENT_TOOL_SANDBOX_CHOWN_PATHS` is set;
  deployments that remove `CHOWN` must leave that env var unset or startup
  fails on the first chown. No privileged mode or host PID is needed.
- **Secret mounts.** Mount Pi config, forge data, LDAP/UI secret files,
  and cloud credentials so they are readable by the root server but not
  by `pi-tools` (for example mode `0600` root-owned files or `0700`
  directories). The sandbox also blocks `/run/secrets` and
  `/var/run/secrets` from model file tools.
- **Read-only root filesystem (optional).** Add `read_only: true` to
  compose with `tmpfs` mounts for `/tmp`, `/home/pi/.npm`, and any other
  regular-mode home/config paths you expect tools to write (for example
  `/home/pi/.config` for GitHub CLI auth) if you want a hardened deploy.
  Native modules + node_modules live in the image, so they're already
  read-only.

## Updating

The image is **not** auto-updating. To pull a new release:

```bash
git pull origin main
BUILD_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

The build is incremental — npm dep resolution caches; only changed source
files trigger a rebuild. Cold builds are ~3-5 minutes; warm rebuilds are
~30 seconds.

If you've forked the project, pin to your fork's image tag in the compose
file and update the tag explicitly.

## Troubleshooting

### Container starts but can't write to `/workspace`

UID mismatch. Check the host owner (`ls -ln <host-workspace-path>`) and
either:

- Rebuild with matching `PUID` / `PGID` build args, OR
- `chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) <host-workspace-path>` to match the
  container's defaults

### Terminal fails to spawn (`posix_spawnp failed`)

The native `node-pty` binding doesn't match the runtime Node version.
Rebuild the image first: `docker compose up -d --build` (note `--build`).
If you're using the running container as a development shell and running
`npm install` against a bind-mounted checkout, the runtime image includes
Python 3.12, `pip`, `make`, and `g++` so node-gyp can rebuild `node-pty`
in place.

### Health check failing on first start

The first request lazy-loads the project registry from disk, which on a
slow filesystem (NFS, network bind mount) can take a few seconds. The
health check has a 10 s start period; tune `start_period` in the compose
file's `healthcheck` block if needed.

### Container can't reach LLM provider

The container needs egress to whatever provider domain you've configured
(`api.anthropic.com`, `api.openai.com`, etc.). On corporate networks behind
an HTTP proxy, set `HTTPS_PROXY` in the environment block.

### `git` commands fail with "fatal: detected dubious ownership"

Recent git versions reject working trees owned by a different UID than
the running process. Either match UIDs (per the bind-mount section
above) or run inside the container:

```bash
docker compose exec pi-forge git config --global --add safe.directory /workspace/<project>
```

The setting persists across container restarts because it lives in the
`pi` user's git config inside `/home/pi/.gitconfig`, which is on the
container filesystem — not on a bind mount. To persist across rebuilds,
add it to the Dockerfile (or use a config-only bind mount).
